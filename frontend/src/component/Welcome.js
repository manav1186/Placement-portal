           Manual Placement which is done at various colleges is by human intervention due to which there is a maximum chance of errors. Placement officers have to manage the student’s profile and their documents and also have to collect the information of various companies who comes for recruitment. They have to arrange profiles of students according to various streams and notify them each time according to company requirements. They are also required to submit the information of students and if any changes or updates are required in the profile of any student, it has to be done manually. This process is so difficult and tedious when the number of students increases. Therefore, a Placement Management System is very useful.
